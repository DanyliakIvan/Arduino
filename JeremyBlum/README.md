2.2:

first pressed - the led turns on.
second - off.
third - on.
...

2.3:

every pressed changes the brightness by 51. after 255 the brightness will be set to 0.



3.1:

connected the potentiometer. we can see numbers from 0 to 1023 in output using Serial PORT.



4.1:

output value from photoresistor (voltage divider) 

4.2: 

the same that in 4.1 and added LED (simple hightlight)

4.3:

the same that in 4.2, but it's smart hightlight (change brightness)


5.1:

controlling the step motor Arduino. stable speed.

5.2:

the motor speed depends on brightness in the room (using photoresistor)

5.3: 

turn the servo from 0 to 180 in increments of 20 degrees





Own:

1:

use 8-bit shift register
